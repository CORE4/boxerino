= boxerino

Boxerino is a tool to assist in managing vagrant boxes in a self hosted repository.
Its main purpose is to edit the .json file that lists all available versions. You
can upload, list, and delete boxes from your repo.

The directory structure ist currently limited to what we use at CORE4 but I am happy
to help you if you want to use it.
